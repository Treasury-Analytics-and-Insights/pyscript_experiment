what was the "putting out" or Verlag system of production

-----------------------------------------

The "putting out" system, also known as the Verlag system, was a form of production that was used in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The system was widely used in the textile industry, but it was also used in other industries, such as shoemaking and carpentry.

In the putting out system, raw materials were provided by a central entrepreneur or capitalist to a network of home-based workers known as "putters-out." These workers would perform various tasks, such as spinning, weaving, or finishing, in their own homes or workshops using their own tools and equipment. Once the work was completed, the finished product would be returned to the central capitalist or entrepreneur, who would then sell it for a profit.

The putting out system allowed for the mass production of goods without the need for a centralized factory or large workforce. However, it also resulted in low wages and poor working conditions for home-based workers, who had little bargaining power and were often dependent on the capitalist for their livelihood.

what is limited liability with regard to firms

-----------------------------------------

Limited liability is a legal concept in which the owners or shareholders of a company are only liable for the company's debts to the extent of their investment. This means that if the company goes bankrupt or incurs substantial debts that it cannot repay, the shareholders' personal assets will not be at risk.

In other words, the shareholders' liability is limited to the value of the shares they hold in the company. For example, if an individual invests $10,000 in a company and the company goes bankrupt, the individual's losses are limited to the $10,000 investment. They are not personally responsible for any additional debts incurred by the company.

In effect, limited liability encourages investment and entrepreneurship by allowing individuals to invest in companies with reduced risks. This has made it easier for businesses to raise capital and take risks that may lead to higher returns, without exposing investors to unlimited liability for the company's obligations.

Limited liability is a commonly used legal structure for businesses, and it is typically established by a company's articles of association and shareholder agreement. It is important to note that limited liability is not absolute, and in certain circumstances, such as fraudulent activities or wrongful trading, shareholders may still be held personally liable for the company's debts.
