# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED

The purpose was to experiment with pyscript as a means to deliver simple data analysis and visualization applications. Subsequent upstream updates to pyscript have led to this application no longer being functional.  The code is left here for reference only - the conversion of the original R to Python might be of interest.
